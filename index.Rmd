Along with growing interests in healthy life and animal protection, the concept of "Vegetarian" or "Vegan" has become more and more familiar among people. Nowadays, we often see the vegetarian or vegan menus in restaurants. Observing the expansion of vegans, "The Economist" said that 2019 would be ["the Year of the Vegan."](https://worldin2019.economist.com/theyearofthevegan) Therefore, it is worth exploring the data about vegetarian or vegan restaurants, recipes, and profiles.
